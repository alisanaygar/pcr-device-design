 PCR Device Design with Temperature Control System using C# GUI

 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is becoming increasingly widespread as an in vitro (laboratory environment) technique, in which a special portion of the DNA chain extends enzymatically, between the two known parts of the DNA chain, to seek and reproduce Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA). Today, PCR devices, which are widely used in medical, biological and genetic laboratories, are known for their long-lasting protocols, high costs and large dimensions. The absence of PCR instrument in Turkey's domestic design and production process is reflected in the high cost. In this study, designing a temperature loop system using Peltier thermoelectric element, driver circuits, the infrastructure to control them with a microcontroller and wired and wireless user interfaces in a rational and precise manner, thus completing chain reactions in a shorter time than the devices used in the industry, and low cost, domestic and portable The development of the prototype PCR device is aimed.
